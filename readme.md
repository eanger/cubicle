Ideas:
    asteroids
    top down shooty game with tons of random mobs
    something like that type game to kill words?
    bullet hell + mob avoid + weapons
    office themed, "mini game" from eggs

To do:
* timer that the worker is working before the chair is built. Maybe make the
  chair slowly become less faded out as its made
