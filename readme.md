Simple game with tons of entities to "practice" the entity component system/data oriented design style system. Needs a ton of bespoke functionality, ie AI.
Ideas:
    asteroids
    top down shooty game with tons of random mobs
    something like that type game to kill words?
    bullet hell + mob avoid + weapons
    office themed, "mini game" from eggs

To do:
* workers oscillate when they can't reach a target that's too close to a collideable
* workers should wander around during their IDLE task
